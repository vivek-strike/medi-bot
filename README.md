### üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
MediBot is based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which helps manage user permissions by assigning roles to each user. This ensures that users only have access to the features and resources they are authorized to use.

1. **Admin Role:**  Has full access to manage the platform, including adding and managing hospitals, doctors, users, and other administrative duties.
2. **User Role:**  Provides access to the website‚Äôs disease prediction features and general data about nearby hospitals and available doctors, but without administrative privileges.

RBAC enhances security by enforcing strict control over what users can view or modify based on their assigned roles.
